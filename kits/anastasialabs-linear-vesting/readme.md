# Linear Vesting

Linear Vesting contract aims at providing a reliable mechanism for releasing Cardano Native Tokens gradually over a specified timeframe, with customization options to fit different requirements.

With so many projects launching on Cardano, many a times, there arises a requirement of vesting a project's own tokens to either their core team or supporters of the project. Vesting assets to beneficiary in proportion to the elapsed time, i.e. Linear Vesting is a very straightforward and common preference. While there definitely exist more complex vesting requirements, we hope that the contract here will help those looking for something simple for their use case. Or serve as a reference for those who want to build more elaborate arrangements.
